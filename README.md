The script:
1. Reads a list of terms from a file (default: terms.txt)
2. Searches for images based on the terms (one by one).
3. Downloads a specified number of images (default=15) for a given terms and shows them as thumbnails.
4. Saves the chosen image, and removes other images downloaded for that term.
